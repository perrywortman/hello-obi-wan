Not just a plugin, but a symbol of hope for an entire generation summed up famously by Obi-Wan: These are NOT the droids you're looking for. 

== Description ==

Not just a plugin, but a symbol of hope and enthusiasm for an entire generation of Star Wars fans summed up most famously by Obi-Wan Kenobi: <q>These are not the droids you're looking for</q>. When activated you will randomly see a quote from <cite>Obi-Wan Kenobi's IMDB page</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. A tip of the hat to Matt Mullenweg for the original code.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Presto. Enjoy. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this show on the front end of my website? =

No, it is only visible to those who have access to see the wp-admin areas of the site.

= I don't see any options, can I make any changes to this plugin? =
Just like the original Hello, Dolly plugin there is not an options panel. Perhaps in a later version, but not right now. 

= Can I customize the look/feel of this plugin via CSS? =
Yes, the quotes are wrapped in the tag, #obi-wan. I'd suggest changing the CSS in your theme's CSS as opposed to the plugins hello-obi-wan.php file. 

= Can I suggest more quotes? =

Sure. Direct any suggestions, problems, or smart remarks to @kloptikus on Twitter
